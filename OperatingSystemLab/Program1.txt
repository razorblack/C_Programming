Theory:  System requirements are the required specifications a device must have in order 
to use certain hardware or software. For example, a computer may require a specific I/O 
port to work with a peripheral device. A smartphone may need a specific operating system 
to run a particular app. Before purchasing a software program or hardware device, you can 
check the system requirements to make sure the product is compatible with your system.

Minimum vs. Recommended Requirements :
Some products include both minimum and recommended system requirements. 
A video game, for instance, may function with the minimum required CPU and GPU, 
but it will perform better with the recommended hardware. A more powerful processor and 
graphics card may produce improved graphics and faster frame rates (FPS).
Some system requirements are not flexible, such as the operating system(s) and 
disk space required for software installation. Others, such as CPU, GPU, and 
RAM requirements may vary significantly between the minimum and recommended requirements.
 When buying or upgrading a software program, it is often wise to make sure your system 
 has close to the recommended requirements to ensure a good user experience.
